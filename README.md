# Book_Cover_identification
this project allow to identify a book by its cover using computer vision algorithms and matching methods.
We used SIFT, SURF, ORB and AKAZE with classic matching and matching with knn and FLANN library, to have such a comparision to know the best method with best parameters for the aim of the project which identifying books.
Some unsupervised learning methods are used like Affinity propagation for clustering to reduce computing time.
